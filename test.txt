Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix

Put on your war paint

The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love

The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love

The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
